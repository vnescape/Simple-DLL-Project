# Simple DLL Project
Just a simple Visual Studio DLL solution.
It can be quite tedious to set up a good Visual Studio DLL project. So this repo can be used as a template to start a solution that builds a DLL and a corresponding client that uses it.
## How to use it?
Open ```DLL_Example.sln``` and click on ```Build->Build Solution```
## How was it built?
I essentially followed this walkthrough (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-creating-and-using-a-dynamic-link-library-cpp?view=msvc-170). I used more generic functions as examples.
